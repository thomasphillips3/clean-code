# Clean Code
Code examples from the book Clean Code

## Overview

I'm reading Clean Code by Robert Martin (Uncle Bob) and will use this repo to type out code to follow along.

### Branches and Lessons
#### Chapter 6: Objects and Data Structures
* Branch: [proceduralShape](https://github.com/thomasphillips3/clean-code/tree/proceduralShape)
* "Objects hide their data behind abstractions and expose functions that operate on that data. Data structures expose their data and have no meaningful functions."
* Procedural code with data structures - easier to add functions without changing data structures
* Object-oriented code - easier to add classes without changing functions
